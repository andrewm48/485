First you enter the path for the file or directory you want and if will print out the information and make the gv file. 
I tried to get the gv file to output correctly but when making the pdf I kept getting compile errors so i made sure that the output to the screen was nice and formated 
showed some extra stuff like if the file is a directory or a file and the last time the file was modified.
